    <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>We offer a comprehensive 8 months 11-plus course that runs from early January to the end of August. This course is aimed at primary school children who are currently in year 5. The teaching and the preparatory assessments in this course are carefully designed to equip the children with all the skills they need to pass the 11 plus examination which usually take place at the beginning of their year 6 primary school journey.</p>
